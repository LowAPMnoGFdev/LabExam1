## üìã Features

- **Real-time Prediction**: Input wine chemical properties and get instant quality predictions
- **Quality Classification**: Wines are classified as "Good Quality" (7+ rating) or "Not Good Quality" (<7 rating)
- **Confidence Scoring**: See how confident the model is in its predictions
- **Feature Importance**: Understand which chemical properties most influence wine quality
- **Quality Improvement Suggestions**: Get actionable recommendations for improving wine quality
- **Professional UI**: Clean, intuitive interface designed for quality assurance teams

## üß™ Chemical Properties Analyzed

The app analyzes 11 key chemical properties:

1. **Fixed Acidity** - Non-volatile acids that don't evaporate
2. **Volatile Acidity** - Amount of acetic acid in wine
3. **Citric Acid** - Adds freshness and flavor
4. **Residual Sugar** - Sugar remaining after fermentation
5. **Chlorides** - Amount of salt in wine
6. **Free Sulfur Dioxide** - Prevents microbial growth and oxidation
7. **Total Sulfur Dioxide** - Total amount of SO2
8. **Density** - Density of wine relative to water
9. **pH** - Acidity/alkalinity level
10. **Sulphates** - Wine additive contributing to SO2 levels
11. **Alcohol** - Alcohol percentage

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- pip

### Local Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/LowAPMnoGFdev/LabExam1.git
   cd LabExam1
   ```

2. **Create virtual environment**
   ```bash

## üî¨ Model Training

The model is trained using a Random Forest classifier with the following pipeline:

1. **Data Loading**: Load wine quality dataset
2. **Preprocessing**: Handle missing values, feature scaling
3. **Feature Engineering**: Binary classification (quality ‚â•7 = Good)
4. **Model Training**: Random Forest with optimized hyperparameters
5. **Evaluation**: Cross-validation and performance metrics
6. **Model Persistence**: Save trained model and scaler
