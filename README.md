### Step 1: Set Up Your Google Colab Environment

1. **Open Google Colab**: Go to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).
2. **Create a New Notebook**: Click on "File" > "New Notebook".

### Step 2: Install Required Libraries

In the first cell of your notebook, install the necessary libraries:

```python
!pip install pandas scikit-learn streamlit
```

### Step 3: Data Preparation

You can use the Wine Quality dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. Load the dataset and prepare it for training.

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

# Load the dataset
url = "https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/wine-quality/winequality-red.csv"
data = pd.read_csv(url, sep=';')

# Display the first few rows of the dataset
data.head()

# Split the dataset into features and target variable
X = data.drop('quality', axis=1)
y = data['quality']

# Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Standardize the features
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_train = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test = scaler.transform(X_test)
```

### Step 4: Model Training

Train a machine learning model (e.g., Random Forest) to predict wine quality.

```python
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Initialize and train the model
model = RandomForestClassifier(random_state=42)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate the model
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print(f"Model Accuracy: {accuracy:.2f}")
```

### Step 5: Create a Streamlit Application

Now, create a Streamlit application to serve as the web interface for your model.

```python
%%writefile app.py
import streamlit as st
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

# Load the model and scaler
model = RandomForestClassifier(random_state=42)
scaler = StandardScaler()

# Define the function to predict wine quality
def predict_wine_quality(features):
    features_scaled = scaler.transform([features])
    prediction = model.predict(features_scaled)
    return prediction[0]

# Streamlit application
st.title("Wine Quality Prediction")
st.write("Enter the chemical attributes of the wine:")

# Input fields for the chemical attributes
fixed_acidity = st.number_input("Fixed Acidity")
volatile_acidity = st.number_input("Volatile Acidity")
citric_acid = st.number_input("Citric Acid")
residual_sugar = st.number_input("Residual Sugar")
chlorides = st.number_input("Chlorides")
free_sulfur_dioxide = st.number_input("Free Sulfur Dioxide")
total_sulfur_dioxide = st.number_input("Total Sulfur Dioxide")
density = st.number_input("Density")
ph = st.number_input("pH")
sulphates = st.number_input("Sulphates")
alcohol = st.number_input("Alcohol")

# Create a button to make predictions
if st.button("Predict"):
    features = [fixed_acidity, volatile_acidity, citric_acid, residual_sugar,
                chlorides, free_sulfur_dioxide, total_sulfur_dioxide,
                density, ph, sulphates, alcohol]
    
    # Make prediction
    quality = predict_wine_quality(features)
    st.write(f"The predicted wine quality is: {quality}")
```

### Step 6: Run the Streamlit Application

To run the Streamlit application, you need to execute the following command in a new cell:

```python
!streamlit run app.py & npx localtunnel --port 8501
```

### Step 7: Access the Application

After running the above command, you will see a URL generated by `localtunnel`. Click on that URL to access your Streamlit application.

### Conclusion

You have now created a web-based application in Google Colab for predicting wine quality based on chemical attributes. You can further enhance this application by adding more features, improving the model, or deploying it on a cloud platform for wider access.
